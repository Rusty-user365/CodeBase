# CodeBase  
### Personal Projects and Learnings  

Welcome to **CodeBase** — a curated collection of my journey through **Generative AI, NLP, and Machine Learning**, built during my MCA in AI/ML and beyond.  

## 📌 About  
This repository documents my hands-on projects, experiments, and learnings across:  
- **Generative AI (GenAI):** Prompt engineering, text generation, and applied LLM workflows.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Feature engineering, text classification, embeddings, and interpretability.  
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Classical models, diagnostics, and reproducible pipelines.  
- **Applied AI/ML Coursework:** Projects and case studies from my MCA program, integrating theory with practice.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
- To showcase my **project timeline** and growth in AI/ML.  
- To serve as a **knowledge base** for reproducible scripts, modular workflows, and automation logic.  
- To reflect my focus on **clarity, maintainability, and edge-case handling** in real-world scenarios.  

## 📂 Structure
