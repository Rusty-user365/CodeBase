# üì∞ Fake News Detection Using Logistic Regression

## üìå Project Overview

This skill-building project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their **titles** and **content**. With the rise of misinformation online, automated detection of fake news is a critical challenge in NLP and data science.

You will work with a labeled dataset of news articles and apply **text preprocessing**, **TF-IDF feature extraction**, and **Logistic Regression** to build and evaluate a classification model.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The dataset contains two labeled subsets:

- **Fake News**: Articles known to contain misleading or false information.
- **Real News**: Articles from verified and reputable sources.

Each entry includes:
- `title`: Headline of the article
- `text`: Full content of the article
- `News_Type`: Binary label (`FAKE` or `REAL`)
